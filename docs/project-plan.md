# AI-Generated Million Dollar Homepage on Flow Blockchain

This document outlines the architecture and implementation plan for an NFT-based pixel art marketplace with AI generation capabilities built on the Flow blockchain.

## Project Overview

This project reimagines the classic "Million Dollar Homepage" concept with two key innovations:

1. Users can generate pixel art using AI instead of uploading their own
2. The platform is built on Flow blockchain, with purchases made in Flow tokens and ownership recorded as NFTs

## Architecture Components

### 1. Flow Blockchain Integration

#### NFT Standards

- Implement Flow's native NFT standard for universal compatibility across wallets and marketplaces
- Use MetadataViews.Resolver interface for structured, interoperable metadata
- Support batch transfers and royalties through standard implementations

#### Smart Contracts

- Leverage NFTStorefrontV2 for non-custodial NFT listings and marketplace functionality
- Build with Cadence (Flow's resource-oriented programming language) for enhanced digital asset security
- Implement composable smart contracts integrating both NFT and fungible token standards
- Reference Kitty Items implementation for contract examples, scripts, and transactions

#### Wallet Integration

- Support Flow Wallet

#### Payment Processing

- Use FLOW token for native payments
- Implement royalty payments for creators on secondary sales
- Support peer-to-peer payments utilizing NFTStorefrontV2 contract's purchase API

### 2. AI Image Generation

#### Generation API

- Hybrid approach:
  - OpenAI GPT-Image-1 for high-quality artistic content ($0.018-0.19 per image)
  - Stability AI for volume generation with cost-effective credit system ($0.08 per image)

#### Cost Management

- Tiered generation packages with transparent fee structure in $FLOW tokens
- Smart contracts for splitting payments between:
  - AI provider fees
  - Marketplace commission
  - Creator royalties

#### Image Storage

- Store final NFT images on Flow Blockchain as it has built in storage

#### Pixel Art Constraints

- Standardize on 1024Ã—1024px resolution for base images
- Implement client-side optimization for different display contexts
- Store both high-res and pixel art versions with clear linking in metadata
- Use Flow's Cadence smart contracts to verify image integrity through hash validation

### 3. Application Architecture

#### Frontend

- Next.js application with React
- Interactive canvas for selecting/viewing pixel areas
- AI prompt interface for generating pixel art
- Wallet connection and transaction management

#### Backend

- Middleware layer that coordinates:
  - AI image generation process
  - Payment processing in $FLOW tokens
  - Interaction with Flow blockchain for minting and marketplace functionality

#### Smart Contract Layer

- Implement pixel ownership registry
- Handle token transfers and listings
- Manage royalty distribution
- Store and validate metadata

## Implementation Roadmap

### Phase 1: Foundation

- Set up Next.js project structure
- Use @onflow/kit for simple frontend integration with flow
- Implement basic Flow wallet integration
- Create initial Cadence contracts for NFT functionality
- Develop pixel grid visualization

### Phase 2: Core Features

- Integrate AI image generation APIs
- Implement pixel area selection and purchase flow
- Create metadata storage and linking system
- Develop NFT minting functionality

### Phase 3: Marketplace

- Build NFTStorefrontV2 integration
- Implement secondary market for pixel areas
- Add royalty distribution system
- Develop user profiles and collections

### Phase 4: Enhancement

- Add social features and sharing
- Implement governance mechanisms
- Add community features and challenges
- Optimize for mobile experience

## Technical Considerations

### Scalability

- Leverage Flow's high throughput for handling transaction volume
- Implement efficient storage patterns for NFTs directly on the flow chain
- Consider sharding for pixel grid data as the platform grows

### Security

- Audit all smart contracts before deployment
- Implement secure wallet connection patterns
- Protect AI generation from abuse/inappropriate content
- Secure API keys and sensitive configuration

### User Experience

- Minimize blockchain complexity for mainstream users
- Provide clear feedback during transaction processes
- Optimize wallet connection flow
- Make AI prompt interface intuitive and efficient

## Conclusion

This project combines the viral appeal of the original Million Dollar Homepage with modern blockchain and AI technology. By building on Flow, we're able to offer a user-friendly experience with low transaction costs while still providing true ownership through NFTs. The AI generation component adds a unique creative dimension that wasn't possible in the original concept.
